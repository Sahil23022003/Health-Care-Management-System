# Health-Care-Management-System
Based on Covid-19 scenario we developed an feasible healthcare website through which users can get to know about the
availability of hospital beds such as ICU ward,Normal Ward, Covid Wards, etc through their locality, ambulance availability,etc.
Project contains Admin and User sections; admin panel is used to update the count of availability system while the user panel is
used for displaying content without any external change.
